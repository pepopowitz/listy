# Listy client

This is the Listy React app. It's a React app that manages lists of friends. I built it in support of a workshop I'm currently putting together, on building a React app.

## Running the React app

1. Install dependencies.

`npm install`

2. Start up the app.

`npm start`

Note: You probably want to run both the API and React app. That can be done by running `npm start` at the root of the repository! [Check out the docs](../README.md#running-the-app).

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
